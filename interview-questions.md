# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: I have used both in class, git refers to commands used to access Github which is a repository that is cloud-based and can host differnt developer accounts. Git is a version control tool which creates a snapshot of your saved code at any given point in time. My instructor used the Avenger's End game movie to explain this concept. There are different versions but they all live on the Github repository which can store files and developer projects. 

  Researched answer:
Git is open-source tool that is installed on their computer to manage source code. Github is a service that is now owned by Microsoft. It is cloud-based and utilizes git tools. It allows developers who use git to connect and upload or download resources. Github is an essential part of open source development. Git is maintained by the Linux foundation and uses the command line in a terminal (Mac) or Powershell in PC. It has a desktop interface but most developer use the command line. Github is focused on being a place where source code can be hosted. It has both free options or tiers and paid tiers.


2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer:A boolean value is true or false and it is a primitive data type. In my javascript programming I have used conditional operators to return a boolean value. You can use conditional operators in functions, loops, with objects and variables. They are quite useful to compare different data. The javascript operators that return a boolean value are and, or, not. and is && and or is || and not is !

  Researched answer:
The OR operator is used for two or more boolean variables. The computer checks to see if any of the variables match, either one can match and this creates a true. If neither match, this creates a false. The AND operator works in a similar way but each variable must match the condition in order for the condition to be true. If one doesn't match the condition is false. The NOT operator is similar to the and and or but in this case it reverses the condition being asked. If !true is equal to not true the final result is false because it is the opposite of true. In the same way !False is equal to not false the final result is true because it is the opposite of false.


3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: I have used both indexes and values while programming in both SQL and javascript. An index is like an address, it's where some piece of data lives and can be utlized to find and compare pieces of data. It is used in arrays which is a composite data type in javascript. A value is what is assigned to a variable, it can be a number, string, array etc. Indexes start with 0. 

  Researched answer: Indexes are used to update, add or delete values. Each element of an array is a value. Values can be stored inside of an array and indexed. An array's index is only numeric. Javascript uses built-in methods like push,shift, unshift to alter values in an array. 



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer:Iteration is the process by which a computer reads code. Iteration is important in software development. You have to know how the computer is going to interpret what you are trying to get it to do. Typically in javascript, the computer executes code from top to bottom but there are ways to keep it executing like loops until the desired output is reached. The command console.log is used in javascript to see what the code the developer writes will output. This is very useful. 

  Researched answer: My answer is not correct. Iteration is a process where code is being repeated until the desired output is met. Iteration is an important concept in programming because it allows us to simplify our code by repeating steps insteading of having to code each step. In other words, a programmer can write code once and execute that same code many times.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Pair programming consists of 2 developers working in tandem, one is the navigator- this person tells the driver what to do and is not actively typing code but instead providing information and instruction to the driver- the one who is actively typing in the code.  The code from the driver is uploaded to a git repository on github. The navigator then pulls the code from the github and the pair switches roles. The pair create a branch that is used during the session and this branch is then merged into the main branch at the end of the day. In my training we utlized pair programming, git commands and processes throughout the training. Most modern software developers use pair programming and it is an important part of agile development.

  Researched answer: Pair programming advantages, include improved design quality, less mistakes, increase in technical skills, improved communication and teamwork. An important part of pair programming is the collaboration having two people approach a problem can help solve it more quickly. Pair programming encourages focus and social interaction as well as accountability. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: a function that can accept another function as a condition and/or can return a function. In other words, it contains the other function and can also return a function as the output. In contrast most lower level functions use a function to produce an output which is not a function.

2. Jest: This is a testing framework that helps to make sure your codebase is correct. It is an open source framework built on javascript. It can work with React and and React Native web applications. It was created by Facebook for a React project. It can be used to test both front-end and back-end applications. Its very useful for front-end testing  and considered easy to use and setup. It has command line tools, a library and support features.

3. Objects: Javascript objects hold values called properties. Objects have methods associated with them. It is considered a data type. Objects can be used to store collections. The Object() command is used to create a wrapper for the specific value. 

4. Method: A method in javascript is an action that can be preformed on objects. "Methods are functions stored as object properties" according to W3 schools. The syntax is objectName.methodName(). There are many built-in methods in javascript, they simplify tasks that a developer often uses. A method is a function in object-orientated programming. An important rule, methods are not constructors.

5. Classes: Classes are used as a template or outline for creating objects. They are created using the syntax, class ClassName {
  constructor() { ...}
}
It is also important to remember that a class is not an object. You use class to create an object. Classes can use methods.
